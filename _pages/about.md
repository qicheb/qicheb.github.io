Hi! I’m Qingtao, a Research Assistant by training with a background in photonics, optoelectronics, microwaves and antennas. Now I am working at [Fabulas Laboratory](https://fabulas.grames.polymtl.ca/) of [Poly-Grames Research Center](https://www.grames.polymtl.ca/) in [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/), which is affiliated with the [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), Montreal, Canada. Based on my professonal background, I have enough expertise in the design and measurement of waveguides and waveguide-based Bragg gratings in transparent materials, and designing sub-THz photodetectors on III-V and IV substrates and fabrication in clean room, as well as the photodetectors compatible-integration with antennas. My research and exploration of the unknown are all grounded in science and technology, which might be expexted to direct and serve the human society in the future.

## Research Interests
*	Femtosecond (fs) laser writing of waveguides and waveguide-based gratings <br>
*	Sub-THz and high-responsivity uni-traveling-carrier photodetectors (UTC-PDs)  <br>
*	Si-based subwavelength gratings (SWGs) and SWG integrated optoelectronic devices  <br>
*	Sub-THz integrated multi-application antennas with UTC-PDs and UTC-PD arrays  <br>
*	III-V/Si-based device hybrid integration, Epitaxial growth, Devices fabrication in clean room  <br>

## Professional Skills
*	Fabulas Lab in Polytechnique: “The RipperTM”, Polishing Machine, Ando Optical Spectrum Analyzer (AQ6317B), Supercontinuum laser, Power meter (PM100), Luna optical backscatter reflectometer (OBR) 4600, Butt-coupling measurement platform setup <br>
*	Clean room: Photolithograph, Sputtering deposition, Etching (HF, BOE 6:1 (buffered oxide etchant, 6 parts by volume 40% ammonium fluoride and 1 part by volume 49% HF), H2SO4, HCl, H3PO4, etc.), Nanometrics ECV, Dektak 150 surface profilometer, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)  and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) <br>
*	Software: HFSS, CST, FEKO, ADS, Silvaco ATLAS, CrossLight APSYS  <br>
