Hi! I’m Qingtao, a Research Assistant at [Fabulas Laboratory] (https://fabulas.grames.polymtl.ca/) of [Poly-Grames Research Center] (https://www.grames.polymtl.ca/) in Polytechnique Montreal, which is affiliated with University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada. I’m a researcher by training with a background in photonics, optoelectronics, microwaves and antennas. I have enough expertise in the design and measurement of waveguides and waveguide-based Bragg gratings in transparent materials, and designing sub-THz photodetectors on III-V and IV substrates and fabrication in clean room, as well as the photodetectors compatible-integration with antennas. My research and exploration of the unknown are all grounded in science and technology, which inherently might be used to direct and serve the human society.

## Research Interests
[1]	Femtosecond (fs) laser writing of waveguides and waveguide-based gratings <br>
[2]	Sub-THz and high-responsivity uni-traveling-carrier photodetectors (UTC-PDs)  <br>
[3]	Si-based subwavelength gratings (SWGs) and SWG integrated optoelectronic devices  <br>
[4]	Sub-THz integrated multi-application antennas with UTC-PDs and UTC-PD arrays  <br>
[5]	III-V/Si-based device hybrid integration, Epitaxial growth, Devices fabrication in clean room  <br>
