2015-06-30	Oral Presentation	High-speed uni-traveling-carrier photodetector with the new design of absorber and collector  The 20th OptoElectronics and Communications Conference (OECC)  Shanghai, CN  This preseantation introduces the design of high-speed uni-traveling-carrier photodetector (UTC-PD) and three modified uni-traveling-carrier photo-detectors (MUTC-PDs) incorporating different doping profile operating at 1550 nm wavelength.	
2019-11-03	Oral Presentation	High focusing-reflection subwavelength gratings with uni-traveling-carrier photodetector for high responsivity Asia Communications and Photonics Conference (ACP)  Chengdu, CN  High focusing-reflection, non-periodic high-contrast grating integrated with a uni-traveling-carrier photodetector (FR-UTC-PD) is proposed to overcome the bandwidth-responsivity trade-off. The responsivity of the FR-UTC-PD is increased by 36.5% while achieving a 3-dB bandwidth of 18 GHz.
2022-05-18 	Poster Presentation Femtosecond Laser Tailoring of Waveguides in Low-Iron Glass  STARaCom Annual General Meeting  Montreal, QC  We tailor waveguides (WGs) by femtosecond laser (FSL) direct-writing techniques in low-iron glass with up to 50% coupling efficiency. The maximum refractive index (RI) change is up to 1.5×10^(−3)  with a single pass writing. Such waveguides could pave the path for applications in slow-wave optical structures, lab-on-chip and even optical industry.
2022-06-16	Poster Presentation FS Laser Writing of Waveguides with Bragg Gratings  COPL 2022 Annual Conference    Montreal, QC  We demonstrate waveguides (WGs) with 1st-order dot-Bragg gratings and 2nd-order line-Bragg gratings by femtosecond laser (FSL) direct-writing techniques in low-iron glass. Waveguides are made by two overlapping inscription separated by 6 μm center distance. Dot-gratings are inscribed using a single scan by adjusting the repetition rate with a pulse picker. Line-gratings are written across the waveguide with a period of 1.076 μm. The maximum refractive index (RI) change in WGs is up to 1.5×10^(−3) and the coupling efficiency approaches 65%. Such designs could pave the path for applications in slow-wave optical structures, optical data storage, telecommunications, bio-sensing, lab-on-chip and even optical industry.

2022-12-02	Poster Presentation FS Laser Writing of 2nd-order line-Bragg Grating  The 6th Montreal Photonics Networking Event in École de technologie supérieure ÉTS    Montreal, QC   We demonstrate waveguides with 2nd-order line-Bragg gratings by femtosecond laser (FSL) direct-writing techniques in low-iron glass. A 4.4 dB transmission dip is obtained with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55 pm for this 40 mm length grating with a period of 1.076 μm. The polarization dependency is discussed demonstrating a small birefringence value, of order 10^(−6), while the group delay is measured by optical backscatter reflectometer (OBR) and a small group index of 2.3 is obtained due to the weak transmission dip. Such design could pave the path for applications in slow-wave structures in see through materials for phone screens, smart windows, automobile/ aircraft windscreens and even Li-Fi in the future.
